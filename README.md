# Leads Tracker Extension for Chrome

I built this simple Chrome extension in the scope of the course at Scrimba.   
This extension gives the user an opportunity to create a list of URLs by entering one or by saving URL of an active tab.   
The application also allows the user to delete all the saved items.
